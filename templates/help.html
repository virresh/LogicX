                                Hi there,<br>
                                This game will help you to practice some basic concepts of programming in C++ language. For now there are two types of games available to try out:
                                <ol>
                                    <li> Operator Game - Here you will have to guess the correct relation and code it </li>
                                    <li> Pyramids and Loops - Here you will have to construct the correct pyramid as described.</li>
                                </ol>
                                And don't worry, if you get stuck at any level, you will have hints along the way to help you :D.
                                We hope you will enjoy playing them.
                            </p>

                                The Game panel has 5 major windows as shown above.

                                    <li>The Source Code Window: &emsp; You will write your C++ code in this window. A starting code has been given. Note that we will use GNU C++ and not Borland or Turbo C++ here, although the syntax will be same. </li>
                                    <li>The Output window: &emsp; Here any output generated by executing your submitted code will be given. Your goal is to make this output the same as the expected output.</li>

                                Objective of this game is to construct loops so as to match the given pattern. You have to think and deduce what all logics you should put <br>and then implement it to build the given pyramid pattern.

                                This game is a test of your detective skills. You will be given two numbers and the result of a sequence of operations performed <br> using those two numbers. You have to crack the code and win the level.
                                <br>
                                Keep a close watch on the given input and expected output windows. They play an important role in each level.
